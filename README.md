# Private Events

> In this project, we focussed on applying our knowledge of Active Record Associations and Querying to build a web app similar to [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows users to create events and then manage user signups.

The app allows a user to sign up and sign with just their username. A user can view a list of events they have been subscribed to. also attendees of an event can be seen from the event page.

PS: The scope of this project does not cover creating events and subscribing to events, these will be added. Hence the database used for development was pushed for testing purposes.
